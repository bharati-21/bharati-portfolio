                <p>My journey with Computer Science began in secondary school, when I opted for Computer Science + PCM as my major stream for class 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>. What began as a path lacking direction, led to my love for teaching. Hence, I decided to go for <strong class="primary-color">Bachelor of Computer Applications</strong> for my graduation and Computer Science as my major</p>

                <p>Halfway through my graduation degree, I started enjoying programming, and  decided to explore the domain further. After participating in a few inter-collegiate Hackathons, I had a change of heart and took a bold leap from <strong><em class="secondary-color">teaching to programming</em></strong>.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="bg-white" style="font-weight: bold;">Thus began my ride of Software Development, Web Development, Android Application Development, and also Machine Learning.</p>

                <p>I graduated with a degree in <abbr title="Bachelor of Computer Applications">B.C.A.</abbr> in the year 2020. A major question that kept creeping back is <strong>what now, that I am done with college?</strong> I did get placed in a reputed Consulting US firm, but then I didn't know where to go now in terms on learning. I tried exploring Machine Learning and Data Science, but then I found myself in a road block.</p>
                <br />
                <p class="bg-primary-color" style="font-weight: bold;">That's when I discovered <strong class="secondary-color"><a href="https://neog.camp/" target="_blank">neoG.Camp</a></strong> in November 2020. I had a few more months to onboard into the firm, so I utilized that time in building and refactoring my skills. <br/><br/>Not only did this initiative make me confident, it also gave me a proper vision and a guide for my future ahead.</p>
